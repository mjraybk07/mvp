There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  
  DREAM BABY DREAM - Ambient sound generator and mixing tool for better sleep
  
   
## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  
  
  5% of Americans report using a sound conditioner in their bedrooms to help get to sleep (The National Sleep Foundation). 
  
  Adults, children and even babies can benefit from replacing disruptive noise with a more constant sound. Using a sound conditioner / white noise machine is an effective way to mask disturbing sounds and help relax and fall asleep easier.
  

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  
  DREAM BABY DREAM provides a simple interface for users to select from a list of ambient sounds, create a group, adjust levels and create a custom ambient sound experience that can be saved and shared.  The app comes populated with a few custom sound experiences. Users can make as many adjustments as they like until they are happy with their specific settings.  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  
  Other products are not as flexible, the don't give users the ability to create, adjust and save custom sound experiences. They often have low quality sound samples or short, repetitious loops.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  
  DREAM BABY DREAM provides a list of curated sounds, an interface to create groups, add sounds to a group, and a level control for each sound added to the group. Users can mute specific sounds, adjust their volume and replace them with different sounds, and save the custom sound experiences they have created.
  

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  
  Go to the DREAM BABY DREAM website, put on your favorite headphones, select an audio experience and press play, or start creating your own custom sonic experience.



## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  
  "I used to have a boring white noise machine that worked okay. Then I got the DREAM BABY DREAM app and was falling asleep to the sounds of the rainforest with a gentle stream running through it.  Recently, I've created my own space-ocean-dream-castle-starship that lulls me to sleep whenever I need to set the right ambience"
